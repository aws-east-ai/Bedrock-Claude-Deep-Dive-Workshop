# Lab 4 - Tool use (function calling)

## Tool use
Define a toolset for Claude and specify your request in natural language. Claude will then select the appropriate tool to fulfill the task and, when appropriate, execute the corresponding action:

- Extract structured data from unstructured text: Pull names, dates, and amounts from invoices to reduce manual data entry.
- Convert natural language requests into structured API calls: Enable teams to self-serve common actions (e.g., "cancel subscription") with simple commands.
- Answer questions by searching databases or using web APIs: Provide instant, accurate responses to customer inquiries in support chatbots.
- Automate simple tasks through software APIs: Save time and minimize errors in data entry or file management.
- Orchestrate multiple fast Claude subagents for granular tasks: Automatically find the optimal meeting time based on attendee availability.

You can get started with tool use on Amazon Bedrock and build a customer service Chatbot in this lab.
